    <h1>Why Coffee Is the Best Drink</h1>
    <p>
      Coffee is my favorite drink, and it should be yours too! Here are a few reasons why coffee is the top tier drink of all time.

    <h2>Energy Boost</h2>
    <p>
      Everyone knows coffee has caffeine, which obviously helps to keep you awake, but you can PERSONALLY add how much caffeine you want when making your own coffee. This means you can add lots of caffeine if you're really tired and need to get plenty of power for the day, or just a little bit if you're awake but just need that tiniest bit of energy from a cup of coffee. Either way, you get to decide what amount is best for your needs.

    <h2>Endless Customizability</h2>
    <p>
      Coffee is very customizable! There are coffee creamers of just about every flavor in any store you shop at, so it's easy to buy one of your liking and use it with your coffee for a delicious taste. Even if you don't make your own coffees and instead buy them at coffee shops, there are all types of flavors there as well. You will definitely find a specific coffee flavor that suits you, just try different ones until you find one you really connect with. There are even some seasonal ones, like the current in-season Pumpkin Spice Latte or Pumpkin Cream Cold Brew from Starbucks pictured below.

    <h2>All Over The World</h2>
    <p>
      Coffee will most likely never cease to exist; it is EVERYWHERE. Coffee is an international product: you'll find it in every country, every state, even in every city or town. You will never be without it, which just adds to its appeal. When I visited Mexico, my siblings and I got coffee from a Mexican coffee shop, pictured below, that was just as good as the coffee in Chicago. Even in an entirely different country, I was able to enjoy an amazing, spectacular, and unforgettable cup of coffee, just like everyone else should.

    <h2>SUPER EASY TO MAKE</h2>
    <p>
      Coffee is amazing because it's super easy to make. All you need to do is pour hot water into a cup with some coffee grounds, and you're done! If you're like me and prefer cold, iced coffee, then there's a super easy fix.

    <h3>There are three options:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        After mixing the coffee grounds with a little bit of hot water, pour cold water into this mixture, stir, and continue to add cold water until the coffee reaches your desired temperature.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour hot water into a cup with the amount of coffee grounds you choose until the the cup is filled about three-fourths of the way. Then, drop some ice cubes into it and wait for them to melt and cool the coffee. Do NOT completely fill the cup with the initial hot water or it will overflow when the ice cubes melt. Also, making cold/iced coffee using this method will leave your coffee tasting more watered down, so if this really bothers you, add more coffee grounds than what you would usually put to negate this.
      </li>
      <li>
        My preferred method is to pour hot water over the coffee grounds as you would to make hot coffee, but then put it in the fridge once it's cooled down a bit. Take it out once it reaches your desired temperature. For an even richer-tasting coffee though, I recommend covering the cup with some type of layer or lid and leaving it in the fridge for at least 12 hours. This may seem very technical, but this "iced coffee" is now a cold brew, which is more concentrated and overall better tasting.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Also, there are coffee shops just about anywhere, so it's accessible, especially in a large city like Chicago.
