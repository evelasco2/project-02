    <h1>Why Coffee Is the Best Drink</h1>
    <p>
      Coffee is my favorite drink&#44; and it should be yours too&#33; Here are a few reasons why coffee is the top tier drink of all time&#46;

    <h2>Energy Boost</h2>
    <p>
      Everyone knows coffee has caffeine&#44; which obviously helps to keep you awake&#44; but you can PERSONALLY add how much caffeine you want when making your own coffee&#46; This means you can add lots of caffeine if you're really tired and need to get plenty of power for the day&#44; or just a little bit if you're awake but just need that tiniest bit of energy from a cup of coffee&#46; Either way&#44; you get to decide what amount is best for your needs&#46;
    </p>
    <h2>Endless Customizability</h2>
    <p>
      Coffee is very customizable&#33; There are coffee creamers of just about every flavor in any store you shop at&#44; so it's easy to buy one of your liking and use it with your coffee for a delicious taste&#46; Even if you don't make your own coffees and instead buy them at coffee shops&#44; there are all types of flavors there as well&#46; You will definitely find a specific coffee flavor that suits you&#44; just try different ones until you find one you really connect with&#46; There are even some seasonal ones&#44; like the current in&#45;season Pumpkin Spice Latte or Pumpkin Cream Cold Brew from Starbucks pictured&#46;

    <h2>All Over The World</h2>
    <p>
      Coffee will most likely never cease to exist&#59; it is EVERYWHERE&#46; Coffee is an international product: you'll find it in every country&#44; every state&#44; even in every city or town&#46; You will never be without it&#44; which just adds to its appeal&#46; When I visited Mexico&#44; my siblings and I got coffee from a Mexican coffee shop&#44; pictured below&#44; that was just as good as the coffee in Chicago&#46; Even in an entirely different country&#44; I was able to enjoy an amazing&#44; spectacular&#44; and unforgettable cup of coffee&#44; just like everyone else should&#46;

    <h2>Super Easy To Make</h2>
    <p>
      Coffee is amazing because it's super easy to make&#46; All you need to do is pour hot water into a cup with some coffee grounds&#44; and you're done&#33; If you're like me and prefer cold&#44; iced coffee&#44; then there's a super easy fix&#46;
    </p>
    <h3>There are three options:</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="bp-1">
    <ul class="modified-ul">
      <li>
        After mixing the coffee grounds with a little bit of hot water&#44; pour cold water into this mixture&#44; stir&#44; and continue to add cold water until the coffee reaches your desired temperature&#46;
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="footer"></div>
  <div class="bp-2">
    <ul class= "modified-ul">
      <li>
        Pour hot water into a cup with the amount of coffee grounds you choose until the the cup is filled about three&#45;fourths of the way&#46; Then&#44; drop some ice cubes into it and wait for them to melt and cool the coffee&#46; Do NOT completely fill the cup with the initial hot water or it will overflow when the ice cubes melt&#46; Also&#44; making cold&#47;iced coffee using this method will leave your coffee tasting more watered down&#44; so if this really bothers you&#44; add more coffee grounds than what you would usually put to negate this&#46;
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="bp-3">
    <ul class= "modified-ul">
      <li>
        My preferred method is to pour hot water over the coffee grounds as you would to make hot coffee&#44; but then put it in the fridge once it's cooled down a bit&#46; Take it out once it reaches your desired temperature&#46; For an even richer&#45;tasting coffee though&#44; I recommend covering the cup with some type of layer or lid and leaving it in the fridge for at least 12 hours&#46; This may seem very technical&#44; but this &#34;iced coffee&#34; is now a cold brew&#44; which is more concentrated and overall better tasting&#46;
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="footer"></div>
  <div class="third-col">
    <p>
      Also&#44; there are coffee shops just about anywhere&#44; so it's accessible&#44; especially in a large city like Chicago&#46;
