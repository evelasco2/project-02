    <h1>My Life</h1>
    <h2>Hello&#44; my name is Eduardo&#33;</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="intro-2">
    <p>
      I am 17 years old&#44; I attend Jones College Prep&#44; and I am also graduating this year&#33; I am excited to go to college&#44; although I don&#39;t know where I&#39;m going to school after high school yet&#46; Here are a few more things about me&#46;
    </p>

  <div class="first-cont">
    <h2>My Family</h2>
    <p>
      There are actually six people in my family&#44; me included&#46; There&#39;s my parents&#44; my older brother&#44; and my two older sisters&#46; Being the youngest means that I get the butt end of my family&#39;s jokes too many times&#44; but I also get to tease my older siblings for being "old" and I can&#39;t get in trouble because I&#39;m technically right&#46; Making fun of my siblings is how I usually spend my days around them but we&#39;re actually very close with each other&#46; I&#39;ve spent  my entire life with them as the youngest&#44; so it&#39;s impossible not to get along with them&#46; They&#39;re my best friends&#46;
    </p>
    <h2>Living In Chicago</h2>
    <p>
      I am a very &#34;city&#34; type of person&#44; I can&#39;t imagine not living in a city environment like Chicago&#46; I&#39;ve lived here all my life so it&#39;s all I&#39;ve ever known&#44; although I do go to Mexico during the summer and enjoy the time away from the bustling life in the city for a while&#46; Downtown Chicago feels like my safe space&#44; and sometimes before school starts in the morning&#44; I like to just sit at a specific bench with a statue in front of it&#46; It&#39;s peaceful and comforting&#46; I always take a photo whenever I go sit there&#44; and one of them is to the right&#46;

  <div class="third-cont">
    <h2>My Interests</h2>
    <p>
      For as long as I can remember&#44; I have always been drawn to videogames&#46; I had a Nintendo DSi as my first gaming &#34;console&#44;&#34; and I can just imagine all the NintenDogs I&#39;ve forgotten and left behind after all these years&#46; As technology and gaming became more advanced&#44; I followed along and continued to enjoy gaming&#44; especially when I would play with friends&#46; Besides this&#44; I also like to read&#44; but mostly fiction since non&#45;fiction usually bores me&#46; I also love playing soccer and volleyball&#46;
    </p>
    <h2>The Future</h2>
    <p>
      Even though I don&#39;t really like to think about the future since it scares me&#44; I do acknowledge that it is important to have dreams&#46; When I&#39;m older&#44; I want to travel all over the world and see amazing sights I&#39;ve only ever heard of in movies&#46; I wanna visit the Statue of Liberty in New York&#44; the Eiffel Tower in Paris&#44; the Gateway Arch in St&#46; Louis&#44; even the Leaning Tower of Pisa in the city of Pisa&#46; I&#39;ve only ever traveled to Mexico a handful of times&#44; but I want to see more&#46;
